<a 
  <head>
<p>An atom is a particle of matter that uniquely defines achemical element. An atom consists of a central nucleus that is usually surrounded by one or more electrons. Each electron is negatively charged. The nucleus is positively charged, and contains one or more relatively heavy particles known as protons and neutrons.<br>

<p>The idea that everything is made up of atoms, was originated by scientist John Dalton. He is know for creating the Daltons Atomic Theory which states that elements are created by small indivisible particles called atoms.<br>

<p>Dalton’s experiments with gases led to some of the earliest measurements of atomic masses and a concept of atomic structure and reactivity. Dalton’s atomic theory contained the following ideas:<br>

<p>All atoms of a given element are identical.
The atoms of different elements vary in mass and size.
Atoms are indestructible.<br>
  
<p>Chemical reactions may result in their rearrangement, but not their creation or destruction.
Dalton also outlined a law of multiple proportions, which described how reactants will combine in set ratios. Like the early philosophers, Dalton’s theories were not popularly accepted for much of the 19th century, but his ideas have since been accepted, with amendments addressing subatomic particles and the interconversion of energy and mass.<br>

<p>Atoms were created after the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago. As the hot, dense new universe cooled, conditions became suitable for quarks and electrons to form. Quarks came together to form protons and neutrons, and these particles combined into nuclei. This all took place within the first few minutes of the universe's existence.<br>
<p>It took 380,000 years for the universe to cool enough to slow down the electrons so that the nuclei could capture them to form the first atoms. The earliest atoms were primarily hydrogen and helium, which are still the most abundant elements in the universe, according to Jefferson Lab.<br>
<p>Gravity eventually caused clouds of gas to coalesce and form stars, and heavier atoms were and still are created within the stars and sent throughout the universe when the supernova occured.<br>
